# WalterClementsBot
A multipurpose asynchronous discord bot made using the discord.py framework
Featuring over 50 commands, this bot is sure to fit most, if not all, of your needs. 
--------------
Functions of this bot include help with moderation, an interactive economy, entertaining commands to entertain members in your server, and more!

Please note: Economy data is public, the balance leaderboard will display your username and indentifier to people outside your server. 


This bot was originally started back in January as a fun little project but has become so much more - it's a bot that can be used anywhere now. I have learned so, so much from creating this bot and it was how I discovered and learned python.
