# WalterClementsBot
A discord bot made with the discordpy API -- please do not criticize my code I know it's terrible


## v1.8.1


###### Commands: There are a myriad of new commands, including:
  +space, 
  +dog,
  +cat,
  +bird,
  +panda,
  +hug,
  +koalafact,
  +pandafact,
  +dogfact,
  +catfact,
  +chatbot,
  +invite,
  +source,
  +lockdown

###### Fixes/Changes:
- Removed DM autoresponder, screwed everything up.
- :tada: THE BOT IS PUBLIC AGAIN :tada: (can't wait to see how fast this breaks)
- Mods, you can now lockdown your servers to prevent raids.
- The stock market system and leveling system have been removed :pensive:
- Would definitely recommend using +space, epic command
- Autorole works(?) now
- Updated the help command because it was missing quite a few commands.
- Don't worry, the DM autoresponder will be coming back. I think
