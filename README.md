# WalterClementsBot
A multipurpose asynchronous discord bot made using the discord.py framework
Featuring over 50 commands, this bot is sure to fit most, if not all, of your needs.

This bot was originally started back in January as a fun little project but has become so much more - it's a bot that can be used anywhere now. I have learned so, so much from creating this bot and it was how I discovered and learned python.
